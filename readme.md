## 1. Overview

This project is a command-line calculator application built using modern professional software practices, including:

- A plugin-based REPL architecture using the Command Pattern
- Persistent CSV-based history using Pandas
- Dynamic configuration via environment variables
- Logging system for diagnostics and traceability
- Use of exceptions for error handling (EAFP and LBYL)
- Automated testing and continuous integration with GitHub Actions

---

## 2. Core Functionalities

### REPL Command Loop

- User interacts through a Read-Eval-Print Loop.
- Input is interpreted and routed through dynamically loaded plugin commands.
- The `main.py` file initializes the REPL loop and starts the application.

ðŸ“Ž [CLI entry point](https://github.com/l3vzNJIT/midterm/blob/master/calculator/main.py)

### Plugin System (Command Pattern)

- Each calculator command (e.g., Add, Subtract, HistoryPrint) is implemented as a plugin.
- Plugins inherit from a shared `Command` interface and are dynamically routed via the `Invoker` class.

ðŸ“Ž [Command Interface](https://github.com/l3vzNJIT/midterm/blob/master/calculator/commands/command.py)  
ðŸ“Ž [Plugins](https://github.com/l3vzNJIT/midterm/tree/master/calculator/plugins)

---

## 3. Code Structure and Class Responsibilities

### `Command` Interface
Defines the contract for all commands:
- `scope(self, user_input)`: Determines whether the command should handle the input.
- `execute(self, user_input)`: Executes the commandâ€™s logic.

### `Invoker`
Routes user input to the appropriate plugin based on the `scope` method.
Maintains command history in memory and in CSV.

ðŸ“Ž [Invoker](https://github.com/l3vzNJIT/midterm/blob/master/calculator/invoker/invoker.py)

### `HistoryManager`
Encapsulates CSV file operations using Pandas. Supports loading and saving calculation history.
Handles serialization and deserialization of calculation objects.

ðŸ“Ž [HistoryManager](https://github.com/l3vzNJIT/midterm/blob/master/calculator/history/history_manager.py)

### `settings.py`
Loads and exposes environment variables (via `dotenv`) for paths, limits, and log configuration.

ðŸ“Ž [Settings](https://github.com/l3vzNJIT/midterm/blob/master/calculator/config/settings.py)

### `logger.py`
Sets up application-wide logging. Ensures that all logs are recorded in a consistent format and location.

## 4. Design Patterns Used

| Pattern        | Example                                                                 |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Command        | Encapsulates CLI operations                                             |
| Factory        | `Invoker` dynamically instantiates and routes commands                  |
| Strategy       | Plugins define their own `scope` and `execute` methods                  |
| Facade         | `HistoryManager` abstracts CSV and pandas logic                         |
| Singleton      | `logger` configuration is centralized and reused                        |

---

## 5. History Management with Pandas

- Stores up to 5 recent calculations in a CSV file.
- Automatically loads on startup and saves on exit or history modification.
- Uses Pandas for efficient data reading/writing.

ðŸ“Ž [CSV Logic](https://github.com/l3vzNJIT/midterm/blob/master/calculator/history/history_manager.py)

---

## 6. Configuration with Environment Variables

- CSV path, max history size, and logging config are managed via a `.env` file.
- Avoids hardcoded paths and allows flexible deployment.

ðŸ“Ž [Env Settings](https://github.com/l3vzNJIT/midterm/blob/master/calculator/config/settings.py)

---

## 7. Logging

- Uses Pythonâ€™s built-in `logging` module.
- Logs errors, file I/O, command executions, and more.
- Can switch verbosity via `.env` config.

ðŸ“Ž [Logging Config](https://github.com/l3vzNJIT/midterm/blob/master/calculator/utils/logger.py)

---

## 8. Exception Handling

- EAFP style used when reading files or routing user input.
- LBYL used when verifying file paths or directory existence.

ðŸ“Ž [LBYL Example](https://github.com/l3vzNJIT/midterm/blob/master/calculator/history/history_manager.py#L36)  
ðŸ“Ž [EAFP Example](https://github.com/l3vzNJIT/midterm/blob/master/calculator/main.py#L18)

---

## 9. Testing and CI/CD

- Tests written using `pytest`.
- GitHub Actions run tests automatically.
- Goal is 90%+ code coverage.

ðŸ“Ž [Tests](https://github.com/l3vzNJIT/midterm/tree/master/tests)  
ðŸ“Ž [GitHub Actions Workflow](https://github.com/l3vzNJIT/midterm/blob/master/.github/workflows/test.yml)
